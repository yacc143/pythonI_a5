Python I for AI - assignment 4
==============================

This repository contains as a start unittests that I've written from the specs given to us.

Usage:

```
python test_ex1.py
```

That gives you all the failing tests for example `ex1.py`. Now edit it to fix it so it behaves as the specs say,
rerun the tests, in the all the tests should report OK. Or at least you should know why they fail.

`test_ex1.py` is potentially more strigent than the tests that our profs will be using, it also tests as the specs
demand that implementation does not use recursion, while Andreas Sch√∂rgenhofer mentioned in the 10.11.2022 UE class
that this property is only a SHOULD criteria that will not be tested.
