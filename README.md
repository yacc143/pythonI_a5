Python I for AI - assignment 5
==============================

This repository contains as a start unittests that I've written from the specs given to us.

Usage:

```
python test_ex1.py
python ex2.py
python ex3.py
python ex4.py
```

That gives you all the failing tests for example `ex1.py/ex2.py/ex3.py/ex4.py`. Now edit it to fix it so it behaves as the specs say,
rerun the tests, in the all the tests should report OK. Or at least you should know why they fail.

And yes, if you did everything right, the doctests are simply silent, if you want some output, you need to add `verbose=True` to the testmod() call.
